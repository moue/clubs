656|Harvard College Africa Business and Investment Club|Africa provides quintessential grounds for analytical study of poverty and underdevelopment and the role of ethical business in ameliorating some of these problems. This kind of cross-context understanding of poverty, underdevelopment and the role of ethical business practice in ameliorating them,  in an era of globalization and rapid economic transformations-- is imperative for Africa and the developing world in general. The resulting sustainable economic growth for the developing world is essential, especially if the United Nations' Millennium Development Goal of cutting the 1990 poverty rate by half by 2015 is to be realized.

BRYE's selective application process chooses highly dedicated, outstanding tutors who devote Monday or Thursday (or both!), from 3:30-6:00 pm (including travel time), to tutoring.

640|PBHA's Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment Term|RYTE is a weekly tutoring program that serves high school students from Boston's diverse and ever-increasing refugee populations, from Kosovo, Somalia, Vietnam, and Ethiopia. The program pairs Harvard undergraduates with high school students in need of help with English skills, SAT preparation, or other academic subjects.  What makes RYTE a unique program is the type of students we cater to: high school students, ages 15-19, who have been in the U.S. anywhere from 1 month to 7 years. Many of these refugees are expected to attend college after high school by parents and family members, or to work, and so RYTE helps them prepare for college through SAT preparatory classes. Without the ability to achieve high grades in the classroom, where they are competing with native Americans, or even to speak the language, it is extremely difficult for these refugees to keep up and have chances at a bright future.    Tutors and tutees meet weekly on Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  Friday sessions take place at English High School in Jamaica Plain from 2 p.m. until 4 p.m.  Saturday and Sunday sessions take place here at Harvard from 10 a.m. until 12 p.m.  (Tutors meet their students at the Harvard Square T-stop, and then work together in campus classrooms.)  RYTE also sponsors two weekend fieldtrips to help students adjust to the American lifestyle.  Please contact Kay Lee (lee32@fas) with any questions.  RYTE hopes to continue this tradition of guidance to the high school refugee population.  We need your passion and dedication!|1|Undergraduates|||PBHA's Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment Term,Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # ,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|November

Once these items are collected from the various hospitals and healthcare institutions, the members will assemble to clean and sort the supplies and prepare them for shipment to areas in the world where they are most needed. The Harvard College International Healthcare Initiative is an active group which, through its medical supply recovery program, will help its members increase their awareness of the vital role that each of them can play in making a difference around the world.|0|Undergraduates|hcihi@hcs.harvard.edu||Harvard College International Healthcare Initiative,Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # 25,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|March

The Sunday Band--directed by Assistant Director of Bands Mark Olson--plays primarily the music of Count Basie and other classic swing, and only rehearses once a week. We hold auditions in the first two weeks of fall semester to determine placement into the two bands. Both bands perform in separate concerts and jointly host performances.

1240|Harvard Undergraduate Journal of Human Evolutionary Biology|The Harvard Undergraduate Journal of Human Evolutionary Biology is concerned with providing commentary and analysis through written publications on contested and recent findings regarding the evolutionary origins of humans. This group will function as an academic-focused, student-run journal with ties to--but functionally separate from--the Human Evolutionary Biology (HEB) department. The point of the journal is to provide a forum for students specifically interested in Human Evolutionary Biology to express their opinions, criticism, and comments on relevant evolutionary ideas and issues. What makes this unique from a class or newsletter is that it allows expression of ideas beyond a classroom setting, without the pressure of a grade, and without pressure to adhere to specific schools of thought. Additionally, we encourage the use of alternative media of publication including comic strips and interviews. This will promote ownership of evolutionary theory. The sole purpose of the journal is to publish ideas, but a very important alternative purpose is to unite the Harvard HEB community. Harvard will benefit from this journal by increasing free academic dialogue of ideas and fostering a community for discussion outside of a classroom setting.|1|Undergraduates|hujheb@hcs.harvard.edu||Harvard Undergraduate Journal of Human Evolutionary Biology,Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # 433,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|April

The group was established at a time when black students from Harvard, Radcliffe, and other colleges in the Boston area felt themselves becoming increasingly alienated from one another. The choir served not only as a needed source of unity and strength bringing black students together on a regular basis but also as a source of spiritual inspiration. Today that inspiration, unity and strength extend to all those who believe in what the group represents.         The Swahili word ""kuumba,"" loosely translated as ""creativity,"" embodies the choir's mission: to express the creativity and spirituality of black people through song. The Kuumba Singers explore and share the rich musical culture of black people through spirituals, gospel, African folk songs, and contemporary music.         Black music is a manifestation of the black spirit - it speaks to our every emotion. Moreover, black music helps sustain and direct our culture. It reminds us of our past situation in this country, makes us mindful of the present, and gives us hope and guidance for the future.

This is beautiful music that can range from very simple to sophisticated, from loud and lively to somber and soft, from old to new, and from and from regional to universal. Because Mariachi music has a special place in the hearts of many members of Harvard and the surrounding community, because we would like to contribute to the musical and cultural diversity available in the area, (and because it is simply great music!), Harvard students have come together to perform this music since the 2001 school year.

It will create weekly opportunities for students to engage in critical discussion with each other about medical humanities scholarship and also host events in which students can learn from faculty members and healthcare practitioners involved in the medical humanities field.     Importantly, the Medical Humanities Forum will encourage students to collectively reflect on how pre-medical and pre-health experiences relate to their future practice of medicine or other health-related fields. For instance, it will encourage students to explore the often-overlooked question of how humanities studies can prepare aspiring clinicians to treat patients \x{e2}\x{80}\x{93} a responsibility that requires not only scientific knowledge but also the very human ability to engage patients as people.       Students in the Forum will discuss essential questions like this one during weekly meetings and in their writing. To provide an outlet for student voices in the medical humanities, the Forum will maintain an online publication of creative writing, in which students can publish works about the pre-medical and pre-health experiences or about their more general experiences with suffering, illness, and healing. The Forum will also publish on an online blog, in which students can post interviews with medical humanities faculty and healthcare professionals as well as updates about the medical humanities field. Through the scholarship of dedicated students guided by faculty and physicians, the newly emerging medical humanities field has the opportunity to grow and develop on Harvard\x{e2}\x{80}\x{99}s campus.|4|Undergraduates|harvardmedicalhumanities@gmail.com||Harvard College Medical Humanities Forum,Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # ,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|n/a

Founded at the request of community members, the camp seeks to provide a safe space for the 80 campers, ages 6 to 13, for the price of \$95 for the entire summer. Each morning is strictly academic, as campers learn literacy and math in order to prevent summer learning loss and prepare them for the next year in the classroom. In the afternoons, the campers go on field trips and perform their own service projects across the greater Boston area in order to provide them with deeper experiences within their greater community than they generally get in school. MHSP provides crucial services for families who struggle to find affordable, innovative childcare. Many have siblings in the program and return year after year, and MHSP has become a fixture in the community. MHSP also hires 12 teens from the community to work as Junior Counselors. Senior Counselors will live in Roxbury and will work closely with the families of their campers.  MHSP is looking for committed counselors with an interest in poverty, social justice, social work, and education.|0|Undergraduates|MHSP@pbha.org||PBHA's Mission Hill Summer Program,Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # ,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|January

70|Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee|The Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee is dedicated to supporting the Palestinian struggle for self-determination and equality. The PSC is non-sectarian and believes that true peace will be reached only when self-determination and equality are guaranteed to Palestinians. This can only occur if:        1. Israel ends its occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and dismantles the Wall;        2. Equality is given to Palestinian citizens of Israel, who suffer from discrimination within Israeli society and the Israeli legal system; and        3. Palestinian refugees are given the right to return to their homes, a right they are denied simply because they are not Jewish.        The PSC does not prescribe a solution to the struggle; rather, we believe in supporting and amplifying the voices of those working against injustice. Just as the PSC abhors discrimination against Palestinians, we condemn any hatred or discrimination against any racial, ethnic, or religious group. In accordance with these beliefs, we encourage people of all backgrounds to join the Palestinian struggle and show their solidarity with the Palestinian people.|1|Undergraduates|HarvardPSC@gmail.com|http://www.harvardpsc.com|Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee,Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # 236,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|March

1236|Harvard College Review of Environment and Society|The organization publishes the Harvard College Review of Environment and Society.     Much of the contemporary discussions on environment and society have been focused on either one or the other. There has not been a robust multidisciplinary, objective discussion on the competing pressures from environmental groups, business and political leaders.

1227|Harvard College Rootstrikers Association|"Our government is corrupt. Not corrupt in any criminal sense. But corrupt in a perfectly legal sense: special interests bend the levers of power to benefit them at the expense of the rest of us. Both parties are part of the problem. Both have become dependent upon the campaign funding of the tiniest slice of the American people, not to mention the funding of corporations and other non-citizens. That dependency is this corruption. In order to solve this corruption, we must strike at its root. We must all be rootstrikers.        Only the people can force lasting change on this broken system. And that change begins with understanding: The people must recognize that corruption is not just one among many important problems. Corruption is the root problem, that makes solving the others so difficult.        As Henry David Thoreau wrote \x{ef}\x{bf}\x{bd} ""There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."" \x{ef}\x{bf}\x{bd} so will we practice. Our aim is to recruit teachers \x{ef}\x{bf}\x{bd} citizens from every part of society who will work with us to spread the recognition of the corrupting influence of money, and help us build the movement to reform it.         We work with a wide range of groups, all committed to fighting this corruption. But our distinct role is to build and share tools that make it easy for anyone to recognize this signal threat to our Republic.        There is no partisanship in the fight against this corruption. There are liberals, conservatives, and libertarians among our members. And while we don't pretend that we share a common end, we do recognize our common enemy. Our project will live until that enemy has left.         Join us."|2|Undergraduates|rootstrikers@hcs.harvard.edu||Harvard College Rootstrikers Association,Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # 416,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|February
811|PBHA's Roxbury Youth Initiative|Roxbury Youth Initiative is designed to give academic enrichment and personal support to campers aged 6 through 13 from the Roxbury community.

The afternoons are spent participating in field trips and activities that supplement the learning received in the classroom, as well as provide a source of recreation for the children. The goal is to not only promote academic achievement, but also to cultivate excitement about learning, to expose Roxbury children to a world not yet discovered by them, to foster an understanding of how integral they are to the world, and to give the children concrete tolls that they may use later in life to participate and better this world in its greater sense.  Roxbury Youth initiative initially began as two separate camps serving the communities of Academy Homes and Dudley, which are both in Roxbury. Last year these two were combined allowing the program to serve Roxbury as one entity.

1290|Science Theater at Harvard College (ST@HC)|Science Theater at Harvard College is concerned with building and fostering lasting connections between the arts and science communities on campus, by providing funding and support to artists and scientists who are interested in creating theater that deals with science, technology and its wide implications on society. We seek to bring these two communities closer together by (a) hosting events through which artists and scientists can share their knowledge and engage in fruitful discussions, (b) matching up artists and scientists who wish to expand upon their own artistic and intellectual horizons, and (c) providing staffing, technical and funding support to directors interested in producing theater on campus that deals significantly with science, technology and it's societal implications. Our mission is to engage the larger Harvard community through our work, sparking further discussions on the intersection of art and science.  At the end of each semester we will select a student theater production, through a competitive application and interview process, to sponsor and support for the next semester. Eligible shows must deal with science and social or ethical issues surrounding the field. This can be demonstrated either by the play itself or by the director\x{e2}\x{80}\x{99}s interpretation of the play. The selected team can apply through HRDC to use an HRDC venue, or use alternative venues such as the SciBox. As part of our sponsorship we can fund the production costs up to \$500, though our main objective will be to create programming around the performances to bring scientists and artists together.   Finally with our Theater Lab initiative, we want to foster the creation of new theater spaces on campus in which student artists can explore, experiment and fail.  |1|Undergraduates|sciencetheaterboard@gmail.com|http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~stahc/|Science Theater at Harvard College (ST@HC),Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # 439,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|May

501|Harvard College Stem Cell Society|The Harvard College Stem Cell Society is a student organization dedicated to cultivating the interests of students in stem cells and regenerative biology, and to advancing stem cell science by raising awareness and promoting education about the complex concerns surrounding stem cell research. Since their discovery, stem cells have been a fascinating subject of research and a useful tool for genetic manipulations in the laboratory. Due to several seminal discoveries in the recent past, there has been a surge in interest in stem cells and their potential for regenerative therapies in humans; this surge is also seen amongst students at Harvard College.                The goals of the HCSCS extend far beyond merely the science of stem cell research into the realms of politics, law, ethics and morality. Furthermore, the field is filled with myths and misconceptions that have led to negative public responses in the past years. Our organization plans to address these issues by hosting a wide variety of events on campus such as lectures by famous stem cell biologists, and journal clubs to keep students up-to-date on recent discoveries. In addition, our organization will attempt to demystify stem cell research in the eyes of the public and promote stem cell research as a possible career path for the younger generation. Lastly, because our organization will provide students on campus with the support, knowledge and resources to further pursue their interests in stem cells and regenerative biology, we hope to establish a collaborative network of undergraduate researchers with a strong sense of community, using the HCSCS as a forum to voice their opinions and to make friends who share the common interest of stem cells and regenerative biology.|4|Undergraduates|harvardcollegestemcell@gmail.com|http://www.hcscs.org/|Harvard College Stem Cell Society,Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # 173,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|February

1319|Harvard Undergraduate Students for Myanmar |Harvard Students for Myanmar is an organization that serves the purpose of raising awareness about the country of Myanmar (Burma). In 2011, the country began to open up to the rest of the world politically, economically, and culturally, after more than five decades of military rule. Yet still, little is known about this country, which is the biggest by landmass in mainland Southeast Asia. The aim of the organization can be divided into three categories: 1) Talk, 2) Teach, 3) Talent. For the \x{e2}\x{80}\x{9c}Talk\x{e2}\x{80}\x{9d} portion, we aim to promote conversations about Myanmar from a deinstitutionalized perspective. Recently, Western media and different research institutions around the world with self-proclaimed expertise have put forth their views about Myanmar. However, we seek to provide a unique perspective by channeling conversations from people who have been to Myanmar and have seen the country at a more personal, hands-on level. For the \x{e2}\x{80}\x{9c}Teach\x{e2}\x{80}\x{9d} portion, our goal is to provide a more formal education about different areas of Myanmar, from business opportunities, language roots, to political history. As for the \x{e2}\x{80}\x{9c}Talent\x{e2}\x{80}\x{9d} portion, we aim to collaborate with various institutions at Harvard, such as the Ash Center and South Asia Institute, to develop more resources and establish greater opportunities for Harvard students, professors, and research fellows to study about and within Myanmar.|4|Undergraduates|askmeaboutmyanmar@gmail.com|http://askmeaboutmyanmar.com|Harvard Undergraduate Students for Myanmar ,Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # ,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|n/a

415|Harvard S.T.A.G.E. - Student Theater Advancing Growth & Empowerment|Harvard STAGE was conceived by Harvard students as a way to bridge the disconnect between the college and the surrounding community and to emphasize the connection between theater and public service in general.  STAGE does so by bringing college students together with their younger peers to grow through theater and by bringing the broader community together to support it.        STAGE recruits members at the start of each semester.  Members are Harvard students with a talent and interest in any or all of the following areas: theatrical performance, dance, oratory, directing, producing, technical design (lights, costumes, set, sound, props), choreography, music directing, script writing/score composing, etc.  Members must also have a distinguished record of public service and must commit to weekly involvement working with the middle school children in STAGE\x{ef}\x{bf}\x{bd}s after-school program.        Throughout the school year, STAGE members run a weekly after-school program serving children who would otherwise have little or no exposure to the performing arts.  STAGE uses a curriculum designed to introduce children to the basics of theatrical performance, emphasizing the importance of creativity, communication skills, and self-esteem. STAGE members work with the children to help them develop their own theatrical pieces, both reality-based and imaginative.          In December, STAGE hosts ArtSpectacular - a day-long whirlwind tour in which after-school participants are introduced to all aspects of the performing arts by working with different Harvard student arts organizations.           STAGE\x{ef}\x{bf}\x{bd}s afterschool program culminates in a showcase of the students\x{ef}\x{bf}\x{bd} pieces at the end of the year on campus, intended to highlight the achievements of the students and to raise awareness of the potential for the arts in the community.|1|Undergraduates|harvardstage@gmail.com|http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~stage/|Harvard S.T.A.G.E. - Student Theater Advancing Growth &amp; Empowerment,Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH),Box # 101,59 Shepard Street,Cambridge, MA 02138|May

We help inmates  with reading (from sounding out words to discussing political theory), writing (from subject-verb agreement to effective prose), and math (from addition to calculus). We lead some computer use and occasionally offer special classes. The majority of the inmates need help at basic levels or at GED level. Tutors usually assist with homework from daytime classes, but may also design curricula on their own. Directors will gladly help to plan lessons and find materials for any tutor. The program runs Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 6:45 to 10:00 PM and on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Volunteers commit to one night per week. Tutors usually work with the same inmate each week, which makes dedication and attendance essential. The Suffolk House of Correction in South Boston houses about 1800 prisoners: 90% male; most between 21 and 30; most black or Latino; convicted of crimes carrying sentences of no more than 2 years each. We help our inmates build the skills necessary to get jobs and live as responsible citizens.
